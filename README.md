# Reviews mining -  topic modeling

## Data

The dataset consists of 1000 textual review (of a restaurant) and its positive or negative label.

## Assignment

The main task of the project is to apply different text mining methods to investigate what customers like and
dislike about the restaurant. The report should contain methodological details and results & suggestions on what is good or can be improved. The implementation can be done in both R and Python and all of the codes should be saved so you can
provide them if needed.

## Workflow

The purpose of this project is to use **topic modeling** to accurately reveal the true opinions of clients. 

For this, I first started with a **preliminary analysis** for a better understanding of the data.

Further, I used the **VADER model to reveal the sentiment score of reviews** for a better data normalization designed to serve the purpose of a better topic modeling analysis. By having labeled data, helped me in counteracting the model's deficiencies, caused by the ambiguity of human language. The ambiguity of human language is the biggest challenge of text mining.

In the last step of my analysis, using topic modeling, I have revealed the main topics of discussion of the customers regarding the services of the restaurant and I proposed things to maintain or to improve.

## Conclusions

**The following important aspects emerge from the presented analysis:**

**Things to maintain:**
* the bar
* food like: pizza, salad, steak, breakfast, beer

**Things to improve:**
* waiting time
* personnel (in some cases)
* the cold temperature
* bathrooms
* prices
* food like: burgers, vegetables and chicken
